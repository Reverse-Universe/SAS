# Mutual Assistance and Hardship Allowance for Citizens' Community Health Care Plans
## Background
Shanghai, as a typical immigrant city, its migration population's social security issue is outstanding. Huihu (Back to Shanghai) retired educated youth is a special migration group. The movement of educated youth to go and work in the countryside or mountain areas was a widely and deeply influenced social activity that leaded by the government after the foundation of People's Republic of China of which it had become one of the most important events in its history.<br>
They enrolled in the local basic medical insurance scheme, which varies in different provinces or areas in China. However, after they returned back to Shanghai (due to retirement), they cannot transfer their social insurance relation or part of the social insurance fund back to Shanghai, since they had not been the employees in Shanghai. They had contributed most of their youth to the construction of infrastructure in the rural areas of China. What's more, the average reimbursement rate of Shanghai Basic Medical Insuance Scheme is higher than that of others. As a result, they cannot enjoy the same social security rights as the people of Shanghai, so they are more likely to become poorer or disadvantaged groups.<br>
To solve this problem, the Shanghai Municipal Government has launch a medical insurance program called 'Mutual Assistance and Hardship Allowance for Citizens' Community Health Care Plans' since 2004, in order to protect them by solving the physical hardships of the people of this generation and improving the medical security for them.
